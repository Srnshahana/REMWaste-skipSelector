2. **Cards**: Each skip card includes dynamic images and animated interaction states.
3. **State Handling**: `useState` + `useEffect` to manage selection and animations.
4. **Cursor Animation**: Custom follower with easing for smooth tracking.
5. **Bottom Bar**: Appears only after selection and is sticky for better UX.
